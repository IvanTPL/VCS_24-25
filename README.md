### Semantic Segmentation with DenseASPP

*UNIPD, Data Science Master's Degree program, 2024-2025*

---

In this project we have implemented and trained a DenseASPP neural network to perform the task of semantic segmentation. 

The neural network was trained on the [Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/). 

We have also performed some experiments in order to select the best model configuration, such as backbone selection (we tried DenseNet-121, DenseNet-201, MobileNet V3 and ConvNeXt) and number of DenseASPP blocks selection. 

Our best model configuration has achieved mIoU of 54.0% on the validation dataset.
